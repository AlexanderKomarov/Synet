Introduction
============

Synet is a small framework to inference neural network on CPU. Synet uses models previously trained by other deep neural network frameworks such as 
[Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe), [Darknet](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet), 
[Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) and [OpenCV/DNN](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/modules/dnn). 

The main advantages  of Synet are:

* Synet is faster then most other DNN original frameworks (has great one thread CPU performance).
* Synet is header only, small C++ library.
* Synet has only one external dependence - [Simd Library](https://github.com/ermig1979/Simd).
